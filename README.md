# Restaurant-Sales-Dashboard

In this Project I used SQL to explore and analyze the dataset to make findings and draw insights.

I got the dataset from Kaggle and I uploaded it on SQL Server where I performed the analysis. I visualized the results of the analysis and findings using Tableau.

The project can be visited [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/RestaurantSalesPerformance_17062290632400/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
